            <p>Let’s harness AI to do better, deeper work. In CS 199 we’ll build
                a basic understanding of AI and use current tools like chatbots
                in hands-on projects, building skill in using AI effectively and
                responsibly. Exercises will include specializing chatbots
                (without coding) to individual student interests. We’ll also
                discuss policy issues in current and emerging applications of
                AI. Students from all majors are welcome, with no requirements
                for background in computing or advanced mathematics.
            </p>

            <p>Credits in CS199 will apply to the forthcoming minor in
                  Applied
                AI. The minor in applied AI will show future employers in any
                field that you are familiar with the uses and implications of
                this fast-growing technology. If a minor in Applied AI is
                interesting to you, consider taking the follow-on CS 110 Spr
                2026 where you learn to program with AI.
            </p>



            <h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

            <p>CS 199 (pilot for planned AI 101) has no pre-requisites.  In
                particular, you do <em>not</em> need to be a programmer, nor
                will you  become a programmer in this course. You also don't
                need advanced math.  Although there is
                plenty of math in the internals of modern AI models, you can
                grasp their essential characteristics with the math you
                learned in middle school.
            </p>

            <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
            <p>We will follow three interrelated threads in CS 199:  How AI
                models work, how to use them effectively, and how they may
                affect individuals and society.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How AI works: </strong>
                    You will understand basic
                    concepts like
                    deep neural networks, training, and inference,
                    as a foundation for thinking clearly about how to use
                    current and future AI systems and how to consider their
                    potential effects on individuals and society.
                </li>
                <li><strong>How to use AI effectively:</strong>
                    You will practice using
                    currently available tools, iteratively
                    refining prompts and checking output for accuracy and
                    relevance.  Our final project will be
                    <em>customizing</em> a chatbot to assist in an area of
                    interest.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Effects on individuals and society:</strong>
                    Will AI make us all rich, or
                    unemployed and destitute?  Will AI data centers
                    destroy our climate?   Can AI help us be effective
                    as students and scholars, or will it stunt our
                    learning? We will apply what we learn about how AI works
                    and how it can be applied to think more clearly
                    about our choices as
                    individuals and as members of society.

                <h2>Text</h2>
                <p>There is no textbook in CS 199.  Readings will be made
                    available (free) through Canvas.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <p>In this course, you will be <em>required</em>
                    or <em>encouraged</em> to use AI for projects. However
                    there will be specific portions of projects that you must
                    complete <em>without</em> AI, such as checking that a
                    source document exists and has been accurately summarized
                    by AI in another part of a project.  These will be
                    clearly indicated in assignments. In addition, in-class
                    exams and quizzes must be completed without any computer
                    help, including AI.

                <h2>Grading</h2>
                <p>In this pilot offering, grading will be based on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Engagement 15%:  Frequent, simple in-class quizzes
                    will check that you are present and attentive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Exams: 40%
                        <ul class="nested">
                            <li>20% for the best two of three
                            in-class exams.
                            </li>
                            <li>20% for a final exam.
                            </li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>Projects 45%: Two projects using AI
                        as an aid in research, 10% and then 15%, and
                        20% for a third project in which you
                        will assemble a custom chatbot with
                        external knowledge sources to aid research in an
                        area of interest.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Attendance and late work</h3>
                <p>In accordance with UO <em>reason neutral</em> policies,
                I will not make a distinction between <em>excused</em> and
                    <em>unexcused</em> absences.   In lieu of such judgments,
                    the following allowances are made for all students:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only the best two of the three in-class exams during
                        the term will count toward your grade.  You can miss
                        one exam completely with no penalty, or have one
                        really bad day.  (However, there will be no
                        make-up exams.)
                    </li>
                    <li>One project may be turned in up to 1 week late with
                        no penalty.   Other late work will be assessed a
                        penalty of 1% per hour.  No late work will be
                        accepted after Monday of week 10, except the final
                        project which may be turned in late (with the usual
                        penalty) by Friday of week 10.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Standard exceptions to this policy will follow UO
                    guidelines, including arrangements in advance for
                    religious holidays and accommodations following
                    recommendations of the Accessible Education Center. In
                    fairness to other students, I
                    will not make ad hoc exceptions.</p>
                <h3>Grading scale</h3>
                <p>In this initial offering I will use a classic
                point system for grading.
                </p>
