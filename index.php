            <p>Let’s harness AI to do better, deeper work. In CS 199 we’ll build
                a basic understanding of AI and use current tools like chatbots
                in hands-on projects, building skill in using AI effectively and
                responsibly. Exercises will include specializing chatbots
                (without coding) to individual student interests. We’ll also
                discuss policy issues in current and emerging applications of
                AI. Students from all majors are welcome, with no requirements
                for background in computing or advanced mathematics.
            </p>

            <p>Credits in CS199 will apply to the forthcoming minor in
                  Applied
                AI. The minor in applied AI will show future employers in any
                field that you are familiar with the uses and implications of
                this fast-growing technology. If a minor in Applied AI is
                interesting to you, consider taking the follow-on CS 110 Spr
                2026 where you learn to program with AI.

            <h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

            <p>CS 199 (pilot for planned AI 101) has no pre-requisites.  In
                particular, you do <em>not</em> need to be a programmer, nor
                will you  become a programmer in this course. You also don't
                need advanced math.  Although there is
                plenty of math in the internals of modern AI models, you can
                grasp their essential characteristics with the math you
                learned in middle school.
            </p>

            <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
            <p>We will follow three interrelated threads in CS 199:  How AI
                models work, how to use them effectively, and how they may
                affect individuals and society.</p>

                <p>There is no textbook in CS 199.  Readings will be made
                    available (free) through Canvas.</p>
